<h1>Astrology</h1>
<p>Yesterday, the cold weather cleared up the sky and when I was outside the city I got to look up at the twinkling stars and follow them as they darted and dodged behind meteors and comets. The stars were talking and shifting around trying to confuse astrologers.  The night sky was more alive than ever like an awoken child not willing to go back to sleep, each star burned with an intensity that only youth can give and even old stars that had inner rings of iron, aging it billions of years, were young and wild in the night.</p>

<p>Looking up, it was all strange and wondrous, and in some way familiar even though I didn't know what was going to happen.  And I thought about all the astrologers thinking they could look up at the stars and tell the future like some palm reader or fortune teller, and how the futures they had read yesterday were all changed now.  And now they must be estranged by all this.  But I’m not at all.  The sky may look different, but its twinkle I’ve seen before.  Twinkling with youth and vitality and lust and love; it’s the same twinkle I see in your eyes when our lips touch and our hearts are close.</p>
