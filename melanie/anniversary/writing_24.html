<h1>Spit</h1>
<p>double words, words meaning double<br />
everything is double with you and me<br />
everything is twice as much and sometimes its too much<br />
but you're never there even though I am there but you are there and your not because in the morning you don't know you were there, you were there. </p>

<p>You giggled and giggled and I loved the giggle even though i never like giggles but its your giggle and its a giggle i'm not supposed to hear.  I float up on you giggle that I feel like I might be inside you in the giggle and I am inside when you giggle.  Let me be inside and you giggle and wake up and just giggle when they ask where you slept.</p>


<p>My secret dreams and my secret dreams, I wish they would come true. </p>


<p>even with the black ooze coming down the hills and the angry father rules you giggle.  Who are you? what am I? oh i forgot i was dreaming.  I'll try to forget i'm dreaming again, I like it when its real and your face is real and I can touch it rather than spin like an astronaut without an umbilical.  Spinning astronauts get hit by asteroids and I worry if you come out here to outer space where I'm hanging out that we'll both get hit by an asteroid.  </p>

<p>who sleeps under playground sets, we do and sometimes i accidentally spit on you but who doesn't spit on someone they love eventually.  I bet you don't remember, I haven't asked yet but I bet you don't remember because I can't remember if we were drunk or if we were dreaming but they are about the same.  Drunken dreaming spots our retinas, takes up the little black dots and feeds our brains with visions of you and me.  Drunken dreams of you slip me more glasses of wine.  </p>

<p>Your face closes in and I know what is to come and we kissed in our heads but not in the air.</p>
