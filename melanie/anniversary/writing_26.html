<h1>The Bat</h1>
<p>The bat hunts when its dark as a crypt<br />
and the sky and earth convolve into a single wave.<br />
Each bug he eats is someone's dream<br />
buzzing towards the sun but killed before dawn's gleam.<br />
I say we beat him to the punch<br />
stay awake all night and fume all that floats.</p>
