<h1>The Lull</h1>
<p>The Lulling Motions of Attraction<br />
When it comes it is,<br />
through snapping lines of flux,<br />
drudging and grudging <br />
speeding through a timed collapse;<br />
It lulls like the last did <br />
and comes very hapless,<br />
moves by magnetic pulse,<br />
running blood like wire,<br />
starting from my heart,<br />
ending in desire.</p>
