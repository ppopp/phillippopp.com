<h1>Over the Pier</h1>

<p>Tomorrow we dance and run in the street<br />
from the ghosts so surreal and mad that we meet.<br />
Out to the water on foot and on plank<br />
run with your eyes fixed past the bank.<br />
Open your lips and give me the sign<br />
I'll jump into yours and you into mine.<br />
Even to ghosts we'll have disappeared, <br />
like mysterious figures over the pier.</p>
