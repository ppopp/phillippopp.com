<p>I like full moons.  They reiterate the sense of scale across to everyone.  Its just a big rock glowing on the inside of the sphere we look up at and call the sky.  And the fact that the universe is ever expanding and unmeasurable, and that I'm just a spec of dust within it, that doesn't bother me at all.  It makes things feel right.  It frees me like I'm hungry and at a potluck.  There are no rules to follow, no goals to achieve, just life and death and what we do in-between.  I feel pretty cheesey quoting from founding American documents, but "the persuit of happiness" is complexly appropriate.  Its not the achievement of happiness, but chasing after it.  And even then, putting life into 4 conventient words "the pursuit of happiness" is really just a silly abstraction.  Its the pursuit of life and culture.  The pursuit of releasing happy chemicals into our brains</p>



<p>I have no clue what it is to be woman.  I wonder if woman know what its like to be man.  I wonder if you know what its like to be a man.  It goes against my nature to believe that these stereotypes have anything to say, I'm nurtured to disbelieve nature.  But we're here, paired, in a love that only feels natural, that has the momentum of spring blooming out of winter.  And I'm a man, and you're a woman, and we've never attacked that notion of the roles we play.  
Sometimes I think to myself "fuck it" and look for something to disassemble but come up empty handed, with nothing to take apart, nothing to break down and build back up again, nothing to make new.  You be the man, I'll be the woman.  We can take that apart.  We can build it back up forgetting the little things that make me a man and you a woman.  See what we become.  Its something we need to do.  I don't want things to be like they were when you were here.  Things were beautiful, stalling, conflicted and heart-breaking.  I loved it when you were here.  It was the happiest time of my life.  But not notorious enough.  I am the woman, you're the man, we will be scandalous. </p>



<p>I like being a comedian, but I don't want my life to be a comedy and at times I see the one seeping into the other.  I fantasize of a life as a drama or a tragedy, a documentary or a chick flick.  Anything really, anything with meaning whether it be rhetoric and esoteric, or simple and engrained.  Because I lack meaning, I need to find it.  And can't wait any longer.  I have a few actors in this, you are the lead, then there is music, and literature, and appreciating the clarity that comes with depression, and the foresight that comes with elation.  My family isn't one of them.  They are the comedy.  Of course I will visit them and love them and stay close to them always.  But they are comedians in a comedy, and I've always felt like that has kept my at a distance from them.  Still, I feel closer to them now than I have in a long time, and its closeness in the strangest ways.</p>

<p>I would like to live in a tall building if we could.  So we can watch the sun set over the pacific and feel like we are at the edge of the world, the last ones to be awake watching the day draw its curtains.  </p>


<p>Rebellion is a way of life. Its the only life I know, tactful rebellion.  And as "ways of life" go, rebellion has to be in my life.  I tend lean upon my childhood and use it to reason about myself.  And then I ask it questions like "how did I become an atheist" or "why do I need to be alone" or "what did I have then that I didn't have now?"  And two things come out, two quite contradictory things, peace and rebellion.  Peace of the farm, rebellion towards the isolation.  When I try to think of it, it comes as a haze, an encompassing bubble of floating memories and feelings.  The rebellion aspect of it can be summed up pretty easily.  I grew up with conservative catholic parents who were keen to think for themselves but used the lessons from their upbringing as concrete principles that life is based off of.  And so their conclusions are thoughtful and provocative, but constrained to a doctrine.  And I'm one generation removed, challenging the doctrine.</p>

<p>My mom likes to tell me this story about how smart of a mother she is.  She had been with one of the other nurse's children, and they were playing with a puppy.  My mom never tells details, but after seeing her around Max, I've gained the capacity to see her in this supremely motherly state, gayly playing with a kid and a puppy, enjoying it, and applying her analytical mind to it at the same time.  She asks the kid "oh isn't that a nice kitty?" knowing its a puppy.  And the kid agreed with her general sentiment.  It is nice, it is a kitty.  But of course it was a puppy, and my mom was testing her to see if she realized it was a puppy rather than a kitty, and the child didn't.  Maybe the child agreed with the "nice" more than the "kitty."  And as kids go, I can imagine that exact categorization of abstractions isn't that important, but my mom thought it was important.  She wanted me to question and challenge.  I can see why.  She's always been stubborn, and trusted her own thoughts above everyone else's.  And she saw this anecdote as an exemplary demonstration of that.  Her love of me, and understanding that I would have to address the world on my own laurels and with my own thoughts. 
My mom doesn't tell stories.  She's bad at it.  My family is bad at story telling in general.  I've tried to become good at it, but I still find myself in the middle of telling a story with no way out and ending it with a shrug of the shoulders and a "well thats it."  But there are a few stories she has, and she never tells me them more than once.  She told me that one about the child and the puppy once.  She told me another one once, about her as a child.  She had hurt her arm.  She never speaks much about her father, my grandpa.  The only things I've learned were through grandma and she told me a story about him getting angry and chickens and strangling one.  Not really a happy family story by any measure.  And the one my mom told me painted him in quite a delinquent picture.  I've really no clue what sort of man he was, and I don't think I'll ever find out.  She had come home, and hurt her arm badly.  Perhaps the inner nurse of her youth was just blossoming, but she knew it was broken.  She approached her father about the arm.  He was watching tv, and slightly thinking about medical bills, and looked at her, and told her to go away.  "Ask your mother" was the line she told me.  And so much can be extrapolated form the image of a dad watching tv, with 6 kids, seeing a broken arm and telling the daughter to "go ask your mother."  And she did just that.  Its hard to say what really happened.  My mom tends to organize things in her mind one way, and then the way she's figured it out becomes truth.  She told me that her mother wouldn't take her to the hospital because her mother that her father would get mad at the bill.  Could be true.  I'm not sure my mom liked my grandpa much.  My mom walked herself to the hospital, her arm was broken, and the doctor called my grandparents about it.  My mom relies on her own resilience.  Not constantly, but she knows its always there.</p>


<p>I was thinking about the piano my grandma gave me.  And I forgot she had passed and forgot that I still haven't really processed that. I need to see her grave.  I still can't imagine her gone.</p>

<p>You are a drunk dialing queen.</p>

<p>I just downloaded a new Black Keys album and another Fleet Foxes album.  I've alot of music to give you when I see you.</p>

<p>Alot of things have happened these last two years while I've been in Santa Barbara.  I've had moments of insane jealousy that i never knew I could have.  I've turned down random girls at the bar knowing they could never measure up to you.  I've written to your email and woken up early the next morning to delete it before you could read it.  I've written you letters that were never sent.   </p>

<p>Its a fair question to ask, what constitutes all these things I've never said.  We're both people who find themselves in emotional flux.  Pulled in by the tides and then pulled back out.  Consigned to the moon, indentured to the stars, whisked away by the flaps of a butterfly, I would've never fallen desperately in love with you if you were any different.  The things I've said, or written, that you haven't heard were under another influence.  Not a devilish influence, not a singular stubbornness, but of a creeping lonely desperation, that speaks like a cold whisper down my neck, or the lonesome crashes of waves upon empty beach.   Its something I'm prone to while you're far away.  I miss you painfully, and have no idea how to deal with it.  I've had flashes of it before, though in much more moderate doses.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what I just wrote explains it.  I don't mean to put you on a pedestal.  I see you as an equal (which could drift onto another discussion all together because for me thats a very nuanced thing to say).   You have a certain unresolvable dichomety that I can't explain, other than to admit that people are hypocritical, and what makes us human is our hypocrisies.  So the hypocrisy.  The woman I've been in love with, ever since I lost my religion at the age of 15, has become my new faith, something, if anything, to believe in.  False idols i've worshipped.  Been through a few, as I'm sure you've been through a similar amount, but that is not something I'm concerned nor interested in, except to the extent that it reminds me of my own sexual humanity (which is the point of this entire email).  You are my confessor, I'm catholic.  Things have been far away between us, and I yearn for your closeness.  Because I believe in you.  Belief is a strange word for me.  Since I believe in very little.  But you, I believe in, and always will.  The weight of the word "believe" fails me, I'm not sure I could ever explain how you are what steadies my shaking legs, what keeps me excited about the morning, what makes the horizon still alluring.  </p>

<p>If you'll forgive the religious analogies, what's made me so downtrodden lately is the distance from you.  Like being exiled out of Eden, I never knew what I did wrong.  Of course nothing.  I went to grad-school.  When I left I remember saying that we should end our relationship, and then tears in the backyard in Columbia Heights, and changing.  All I want to be is back in that moment, with the euphoria of you by my side; you opening my eyes to see what I nearly lost.  And that's what troubles me now, the distance from what I believe in.  Believing, yet being thousands of miles away. </p>

<p>Really, the reason I started writing this email is because I wanted to ask you whether you'd be up for adoption.  Not now, not till after we have a family.  Not the first child definitely.   In the world we live in, how could we not adopt.  Its not right to not adopt.  I am going to adopt sometime in my life.  I imagine you'll agree with me, but I thought now is an appropriate time to let you know that I'll definitely sometime in my life, and I hope you're with me when it happens.</p>

<p>I'm running out of energy, and conclusions, for this email.  I love you, and I'm going through a difficult time being away from you.  But life is momentary and relative.  I'm not sure how I'll react to living with you, other than that I will be more energetic than you've ever seen me and I'll be the happiest man alive.   Which is why I painfully endure your absence, like waiting for Santa on christmas, its an oddly translucent pain I can't escape.  </p>

<p>I wait for nothing except to see you.<br />
Love<br />
phil</p>

<p>This beautiful plane with these beautiful people are bringing to my beautfiul girlfriend.  Minneapolis is therapy for me.  When I was getting ready to leave for Santa Barbara, I always assumed I would </p>
