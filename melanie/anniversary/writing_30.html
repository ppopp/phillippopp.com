<h1>Our Time</h1>
<p>Our time is a disregarded one, label-less, niche-less, affectless.  Really more of a step in a downward staircase, no better or worse than the previous, no more or less significant except for the first and last step.  The first step is long gone, or non-existent, and the last step will never see it coming.  So to be in our own time can mean very little.  Our time.  So meaningless, so purposeless, but its all we have.  And so if we are to cling to anything, we should cling to our time, because it is now, it will be gone, and there's nothing more real to cling to. </p>
