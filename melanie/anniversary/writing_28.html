<h1>Madeline</h1>
<p>Madeline, Satan's breath blows out his eyes<br />
Tommorow, fly away from here<br />
because tommorow the sky is clear.<br />
You were a blue bird that I loved Madeline,<br />
but i never wanna see you again.</p>

<p>This pistol Shoot's Satan's breath.<br />
I shoot it and deal out death<br />
cause I am satan's eyes<br />
aiming my colt 45.</p>

<p>I shot at his red shirt, I couldn't stop till his knees hit the dirt.<br />
Firing at his red shirt, I couldn't stop till both knees were in the dirt.<br />
And now this 45'll be shot one last time. </p>

<p>Medeline, before you get home tonight<br />
make your wings climb up to the sun.<br />
Don't stop till the brightness blinds your eyes<br />
and you can't see what i have done.</p>

<p>Don't forgive me, and don't you pray.<br />
God had no part in yesterday.<br />
He let your husband die<br />
from satan's breath coming out my 45.</p>

<p>I shot at his red shirt, I couldn't stop till his knees hit the dirt.<br />
Firing at his red shirt, I couldn't stop till both knees were in the dirt.<br />
And now this 45'll be shot one last time.</p>
