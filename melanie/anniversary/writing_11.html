<h1>Dear Melanie</h1>
<p>My words can never travel as far as I’d like.  They have no armor, no legs, no booster rockets to send them into space and let your gravity pull them in like a heavenly meteor onto earth.  They wisp as feathers, and lay as a pillow.  Even now, they are mere padding for a hard rocky life.</p>

<p>I was touched by your email, as I haven’t been in a long time.</p>

<p>How is that for a feather?  It is true, what I say; touched.  Why though, is it that we are so far apart, and at a difficult time, that now I am touched?  It is like the night in Montreal when we made love and the town and the music and the people aligned and it was all too much to bear.  It was too much and everything that is worth crying for.  Distance and love, worry and guilt and suspicion and guilt of suspicion and choices we make that deny ourselves what it is that makes us happy.</p>

<p>If only we could live for a single moment.  Life would be grand if it were a single moment.  Instead it is like a single moment that is relived over and over.  Each time it plays back differently: we are climbing a mountain with Antony, we are drunk from sailor jerry and naked in your bed and free of reservations, we are apart and lonely and telling each other our loneliness doesn’t help.</p>

<p>Loneliness is a cursed drug.</p>

<p>I love you.  To be honest, those silly three words mean nothing to me: I love you.  I know I’m too pragmatic.  But I love you says nothing when it is supposed to say everything.  It says “I am a human and I have the emotion that all humans have towards something.”  It says, “I don’t know what else to say but I want you to stop crying.”  It says, “I’ve fucked everything up but I feel really shitty about it.”  I don’t want to say any of those things.  I adore you.  I need you.  I need you over and over again and I never want it to stop.  I want to cry about you when you are gone.  I want to cry about you when you are here.  I want to be you and to be myself.  I never want to spend a day of my life not knowing that you are somewhere.  So I’ll say it.  But I know how people use it.  And when they use it, they may mean many things.  I only mean one thing.  I mean many things, but always the same things.  I love you.  And I am nothing without you.</p>

<p>But doesn’t time change everything?  Doesn’t time make you feel like you were an imbecile.  I told sara I loved her many times.  Why?  Out of loneliness?  The scourge of hearts.  Its absolutely silly now.  I would say it just to rub it in her face.  Though no, I haven’t the mean spirit for that.  Just bewilderment at the silliness of the words “I love you.” </p>

<p>I can say it again, and differently, and with time it will always mean something else.  Neither of us can account for it.  Perhaps it is best to accept that people are silly things.  Falling in and out of love and forgetting and remembering constantly.  Our minds are train wrecks.  They are buildings being knocked down, and why do we work at them anyway?  It is absolutely uncontrollable.  I tell you, I cannot control my feelings for you.  They are yours.  I give them to you.  I give myself to you.  And yet I take it away.  I do not know how to share myself with you.  But I give it to you now.</p>

<p>You ask me how I feel.  This is how I feel.  I am stunned by how I feel.  I do not know how to say to you, I do not know how to say it to myself.  So I am yours.  And you can see for yourself.  And I am yours, and nothing else.</p>
