<h1>Pillows!</h1>

<p>Pillows on your chest, sleeping on the pillows on your chest.  Nesting on breasts in your sleep.</p>

<p>Your laughing belly grows and shrinks like I’m moving in and out, moving in and moving out you dream wheverever you live where ever I live I dream of you and you giggling and you giglin when my mouth knows what where your lips are going  In and out of you, In and out of you.  </p>

<p>Blacking flashing in out in back black back up back in backout blackout. </p>

<p>Creamy skins and coffee all mixed and floating I mixes you all mixed, I can’t tell you from you, all mixed.  Cream floating in the coffee, interracial cappuccino blend.</p>
