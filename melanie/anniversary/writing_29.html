<h1>Worst Birthday Ever</h1>
<p>madeline<br />
I don't know what to do<br />
I am horrified at life<br />
I don't know what to do</p>

<p>madeline<br />
what am i to do<br />
theres no one i can say this to<br />
but you, but you</p>

<p>i feel dead<br />
dead like nothings true<br />
i feel dead madeline<br />
its because of you</p>

<p>madeline<br />
I felt good<br />
madeline<br />
why you do what you do</p>

<p>look, glass eyes.<br />
i've got glass eyes again.  Right there in the mirror, i see 'em.  <br />
I don't know why i call them glass eyes<br />
they just look like glass<br />
red<br />
and wet, <br />
and shiny<br />
like big polished marbles in my head<br />
glass eyes<br />
and i'm stoned<br />
and i only see them when i'm stoned<br />
and when i see them i look at them<br />
and when i move my eyes<br />
the glass eyes move too<br />
cause they're my eyes</p>

<p>and then whats going on in my life<br />
i've got glass eyes<br />
i'm gone<br />
all weird and mad<br />
and i'm glad i got lost thinking about glass eyes<br />
because things are horrible right now<br />
and they always are when i've got glass eyes</p>

<p>it means i've been doing too much<br />
and am losing my grasp on life<br />
that i've gotta slow down again<br />
i've gotta slow down again</p>

<p>fucking glass eyes<br />
shiny red balls</p>

<p>why do i have to see you<br />
why can't i just have no eyes<br />
so i don't have to see myself and think<br />
i must be mad<br />
just look at me<br />
i must be mad</p>

<p>cause thats what i think<br />
and well if i'm already thinking it, i'm probably fucking mad<br />
fuck i'm mad.</p>
